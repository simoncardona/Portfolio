# About me

I am totally convinced that is not the size or complexity what makes a problem difficult to solve. It is your attitude towards it and your ability to see it as challenge what allows you to propose great solutions. As a physicist I back up my decision process with data; as a mechanical engineer I understand things in the simplest way in order to propose fast and executable solutions, preferring to think more about what if? or why not? than why? questions; as an aspiring entrepreneur I am developing a mindset that is more inclined to innovate and take risks. I use these abilities as a team leader or team member to develop interesting projects and deliver impactful results. 

I am an active reader, runner, juggler and unicyclist. I love my family and friends, and enjoy having new experiences with them. 

# What I hope to learn

I am acquiring the skills in data and business technologies management to complement my analytical background. Enjoying the journey to become a data translator and a great storyteller.
