# Welcome to my Final Project 

The following images show all my ideas about the project so far. They include the summary, the outline, the story arc and some initial sketches with concepts for the final visualizations. They also include some of the data I have been able to gather. The links to that data are the following: 

# Data Sources:

The first data set is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rojour/boston-results) with information from the Boston Marathon finishers since 2017. The data includes features such as gender, total time, country and times in different stages of the race (e.g. 5K, 10K, 15K, etc)

The second data set is from [data.world](https://data.world/scardona/datarunning/workspace/data-dictionary) which includes all the winners of all the marathons around the world since 1978. It includes features such as year, gender, marathon and age.

Finally, I will use my own data downloaded from apps such as [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com) and [Strava](https://www.strava.com). I am still figuring out how to download the data. I will make it available for everyone to review. 

# Part 1: Preliminary Sketchboards

This were initial ideas of how to tell my story. I know my hand writing might be difficult to read, but it was easy for me to express my thoughts in paper and make changes at the same time ideas were coming to my head.

Looking forward to next steps!!

# Part 2: Wireframes and User Research

Some changes since Part 1. I was struggling to find a way to include my own story in the whole narrative that I initially proposed. User feedback was crucial in suggesting the inclusion of a person, that in this case is Lucas. I wanted to build someone very similar to my audience, someone different from me they can identify with. 

In addtion to that, I realized I wanted to talk about Boston Marathon. It is an iconic race, with lots of history. It is the holy grail of the marathons, the race that any amateur to aspires to finish.

Almost there! 

# Parts 3 and 4: Final webpage published

My 1 min. presentation was not as good as I was expecting, but it was still a good test for the audience of my story. I noticed some interesting eyes in my fellow classmates. I believe the inclusion of Lucas fulfilled its purpose. 

In addtion to that, I made some changes in the flow of the story to make the intersection between my story and the world marathon statistic more smoothly. I did not have enough time neither to explain my motivation to make an emphasis in Boston, nor to explain the meaning of the alluvial diagram. The message there was that your age should not be a hurdle to participate, and that as people with less than 40 years old we are completely capable of not only finishing Boston, but also crossing the finish line in less than 3 hours. 

Finally, the graphs with the results of my 10K and 21K races that gave me the confidence and the strength to make the decision to race a marathon. I wanted to emphasis in the difference between best and average pace, to give a sense of the changes in pace that actually happen in such a short amount of time. Besides that, is interesting to see how the pace fluctuates durint the race. Theory says the shape of this graph shoul be more like a downward line where you start slow, steady for the first haf and then you start increasing your pace for the second one. I am far from that. 

I hope you enjoy my story as much as I enjoyed doing it. 
Here is the final result: [Is it possible to finish a marathon?](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/is-it-possible-to-run-a-marathon-/index.html)

Thanks!
