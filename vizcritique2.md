# Part 1: Choose a visualization you can improve

[Follow this link to see the visualization I am trying to improve](https://www.marketingcharts.com/charts/us-on-demand-music-streaming-consumption-2018-2019/attachment/nielsen-music-streaming-consumption-jan2020)

Here is the [article](https://www.marketingcharts.com/industries/media-and-entertainment-111661) that accompanies the visualization. It appeared first on Marketing Charts webpage on January 24, 2020. The source of the data to build the visualization comes from Nielsen.

I chose this visualization because I thought there was some room for improvement after watching it for a while. I am also interested in the music industry, specially the streaming business. It is a trending topic right now, and is changing the way marketing is done. I wanted to dive dip in the topic and that is how I found this graph. 

# Part 2: Critique

The visualization was not transmitting to me the title's message. The word "On-demand" appears 4 times in the graph. It took me some time to realize that the total was the sum of some information that was already present in the same visualization, the sum of audio and video, to be more specific. 

After using the 7 criteria of Stephen Few, I found myself repeating the same two things: the visualization should give the audience a more direct sense of change, growth, in total and in each of the categories; there should be a way to reduce the number of columns in the chart so one can grab the focus of the reader faster. 

# Part 3: Wireframing + Sketching

I had 3 ideas for the sketches: 

* Combine categories in the same columns and put the years in the x-axis
* Use a bar chart to show only the growth (in percentage) year-to-year
* A kind of bar chart where I can locate at the same time quantities and growth

The following are the sketches for each of the aforementioned options:

Some of these ideas aroused just after selecting the visualization in the others after doing the critique following Stephen Few's criteria. I gave low points for Intuitiviness and Completeness: one should not have to sum audio plus video to figure out the total; there are different units in the graph: Billions (B) and Trillions (T). According to the article title (not the visualization), there is an implied emphasis on the fact that the Trillion streamings where achieved. I tried to correct that and to include a sense of growth in the recreation of the visualization.

# Part 4: Test and Feedback

Sharing the sketches with a small audience allowed me to get their insights and to include more improvements. Both of them were more inclined to the first of the 3 ideas. The other 2 were not as "common" as what they were used to see. The third idea specifically sounded completely new (previously unseen) to them. It was new even to me, but I found it interesting to show both growth and quantity at the same time. This made me think of the difficulties of designing something completely new and what that may cause to the audience. Can novelty confuse just for the sake of novelty? Should one stick with what is already in use? The feedback also suggested to include an axis with scale to signal the Trillion threshold, and to use Trillions (T) instead of Billions (B): clearer and simpler graph, less decimal places aka less space. 

# Part 5: My version of the visualization

Here is my recreation of the visualization

![Recreated data visualization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/60082968/73617843-c3f06280-45f0-11ea-81f6-f44176de70b6.png)

I used excel this time to build the column graphs, and included the dotted lines to show the growth in each category. Located the time (years) in the x-axis and the number of streamings in the y-axis. Changed the color pallete to different shades of blue to make it less colorful while still making a difference in the categories. Included three lines with separations of 0.5T. This allowd me to reduce the number of columns from 6 to 2, the number of colors and also (I believe so) I am getting the attention of the user to only one specific part of the graph. The numbers are easier to read and the Source is clear. 

I hope I manage to to improve this visualization with this new approach. Let me know your thoughts about it!
